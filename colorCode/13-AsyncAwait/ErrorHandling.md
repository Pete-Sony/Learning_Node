# Error Handling
Error handling code is commonly used in ajax calls and asynchronous code.
There are different types of error handling keywords.
* **try**  Tests a block of code for errors.
* **catch** Lets you handle error.
* **finally** Lets you execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.
* **throw** Lets you create custom errors.

#### For the try/catch to work, This syntax must not be wrong.It only handles runtime error, so the code has to runnable.
