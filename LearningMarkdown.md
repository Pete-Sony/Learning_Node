Markdown is a markup language, one of the most important  text editing  language. 

There are two views in a markdown file.Editing view and a preview.

Access the heading using a command pallete in vscode.
In the command pallete select open preview to the side, or Ctrl + K.

# This is largest Heading
## This is a Smaller Heading
The more #'s you add your heading will get smaller and smaller until you get to 6.
##### This is the Smallest Heading

Paragraphs continue as the next line 
unless you put an empty line between them.

Like this.

If you want to write in a new line, but in the same paragraph. You put **Two Spaces** at the end of the previous line.  
Like this.


### Flavours of markdown

Markdown has specific things defined in it.  Some people wanted to add on to markdown because they thought the base specification was limited.   
Therefore there are different flavours in markdown, one of the common one being Github flavored markdown(gfm).

### Few useful features  
 This is how you write **bold text**   
 Also you could use __underscore__

 This is how you write *Italicized text*  
 The difference is that you use only one *Asterix* or *Underscore*  

For both **bold** and *Italic* you triple the ***asterix and underscore***  
You can also **_mix and match_**

This is how you ~~cross off~~. By using tilde.
